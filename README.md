## A D&D Any-Edition Compatible Oneshot Decider!

### Adaptable
This program is designed to be easy to change (via the code) and may, at some point, be updated to add App.config functionality and the ability to read/write to csv for easy config storing!

### Lightweight
The solution and associated files are very small, allowing for portability and also storage on a portable and/or lower end device, both of which typically have less storage

### Simple
Once configured, you simply click a button and it's done. If using straight from source you only need to put in the number of players, the number of rules and off you go!

I made this in an afternoon because I wanted to see if I could but since then I have polished it up a bit. Regardless, if there is anything you think could be added just raise an issue!
